# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent of Code] - an advent calendar of programming puzzles.

I'll attempt to solve them with Kotlin.

### Day 1 Calorie Counting

find the elves carrying the most calories.

### Day 2 Rock Paper Scissors

play Rock Paper Scissors based on a provided strategy.

### Day 3 Rucksack Reorganization

help the elves packing their rucksacks.

### Day 4 Camp Cleanup

help the elves discover overlapping assignments.

### Day 5 Supply Stacks

help the elves with logistics.

### Day 6 Tuning Trouble

help the elves with their messages. 

### Day 7 No Space Left On The Device

help the elves with s system update. This if the first puzzle which becomes much easier once you've
figured out what you actually don't have to do. (i.e. a tree lends itself as a feasible data structure,
but it turns out to be hard to parse, 'flattening' the process and just storing sizes to all affected
paths is much easier)

### Day 8 Treetop Tree House

help the elves with finding a nice spot for their tree house. The first grid puzzle of the year, it
was a little tricky to integrate the 'perspective' of each location. (probably it would have been
easier to just use loops and breaks)

### Day 9 Rope Bridge

help the elves crossing a river by simulating a rope bridge.

### Day 10 Cathode-Ray Tube

emulate a very cool CRT.
